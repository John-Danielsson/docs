# What is Hyak?

Hyak is a cluster of computers situated at the UW Tower. These computers are used to perform large, complex calculations or software programs when high computing power is needed. If you were to use a laptop to run a program like those being run on Hyak, it would take thousands of years for the laptop to complete what the Hyak cluster can do in a couple of hours!

# Who can use it?

UW research teams, faculty, and students can all use Hyak, provided that they have an account for the Hyak service.
