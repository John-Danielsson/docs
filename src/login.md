# Logging In

Logging into Hyak is quite easy. If your user ID is "username", logging in via your terminal looks like this:

```ssh username@hyak.washington.edu```

You will then be asked to enter your password, but note you won't be able to see what you're typing, so be mindful. After that, there will be a "push" sent to your DuoMobile account to complete the login. Now you can begin submitting jobs and stuff!
