# OnDemand

## What is it?

OnDemand is an open-source NSF-funded software program made by MIT to let system administrators provide web (remote) access to HPC resources.

## How do I start using it?

Here is a link to [OnDemand's website](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/release-1.6/) where all you can find all the instructions for installing and using OnDemand.

There is also a [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-w-4wjlnPk) showing the various parts of an online OnDemand instance.
