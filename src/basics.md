# Hyak / HPC Basics

## What you should know before using Hyak:

You should be familiar with the Linux command line. Hyak's default shell is bash which is also the default shell on a Mac computer. 

Here is a [link to Software Carpentry's lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) on the bash shell, Python, git, etc. Scroll down for videos of their courses.

Software Carpentry also conducts workshops at UW. See [this link](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) for the next workshop at UW.

Below are some more links to what you should be familiar with prior to using Hyak:
